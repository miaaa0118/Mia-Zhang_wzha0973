# Mia Zhang_wzha0973_Creative coding major project

**1.Instruction**

Upon loading the page, a building composed of red, yellow, blue, and white rectangles gradually rises, layer by layer. 

A new level is added every 40 frames, for a total of 8 levels. 

Meanwhile, the background color transitions from white to black over time. 

The entire animation completes in 320 frames.



**2.Details**

I chose a *time-based* approach to implement my personal code, using timers and events to handle the animation.

I added layer attributes to different parts of the building, allowing them to display in layers. By controlling the display time of each layer, the construction of the four buildings is completed within the specified time.

My animation inspiration comes from the images in this link:[Link Text](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/47710077295467611/)

From this image, the contrast between *different types of buildings in New York* is clearly visible.

My animation is inspired by the development of New York City. Initially, New York was a vibrant, livable city dominated by low-rise residential buildings, with the city’s liveliest moments occurring during the day. However, over time and through rapid urban development, New York gradually transformed into the global metropolis we know today. Modern New York is not only busy during the day, but its nightlife is equally vibrant, making it a true "city that never sleeps." The early part of my animation shows New York in its earlier days, with a calm, daytime cityscape that highlights its livability. As time progresses, the buildings grow higher, layer by layer, gradually shaping the city into an economic hub and international center, with the nighttime scene becoming more bustling and lively, reflecting the city’s growth and transformation.
